# GitHub Teams Overview
As adoption of your **GitHub** instance continues, communicating with the right people can become more difficult. **GitHub Teams** are a great way to encourage collaboration and help your team members discover the expertise and interests of others.

Teams can be visible or secret. Visible teams can be viewed and @mentioned by every organization member, even if they aren't organization owners or members of those teams.  
If you make every team in your organization visible, your members will be able to use team @mentions across your organization.

Utilizing teams in this manner is a powerful way to encourage cross-team collaboration. For example, a developer could @mention a team called *@chicagodmc/design* to ask a about a end-user facing implementation.  
Or a developer could reach out to a team called *@chicagodmc/DevOps* to bring attention to changes that might have a security impact.

## Establishing a Structure
To make sure that you don't create a structure that is difficult to maintain or traverse, below are a few examples to help guide building out the team structure.  

- Team Names should be simple and concise
  - **Example:** *@DevOps* for all security related questions
  - **Example:** *@oracle* for oracle related questions
- Team Names should reflect what the teams purpose is to serve
  - **Example:** *@angular* should be for angular related questions
  - **Example:** *@GooseIslandQA* should be for Goose Island's team QA's
- Nesting Team Names should reflect the teams role as it becomes more specific
  - **Example:** *@chicagoTeams/GooseIsland/GooseIslandQA* would be all the way down to niche team members
